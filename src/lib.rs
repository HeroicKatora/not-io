//! Provides `Read` and `Write` alternatives on `no_std` while being compatible with the full
//! traits from `std` when allowed.
//!
//! ## Motivation
//!
//! The file parser ecosystem of Rust is more or less split across crates that use `no_std` and
//! crates that do not, as well as between crates using `alloc` and no-alloc (and the largely
//! overlapping zero-copy) crates. This has several reasons:
//!
//! * The `std::io::Read` and `std::io::Write` traits require an allocator due to their internal
//!   implementation and were not written to be OS independent.
//! * Before `1.36` it was not possible to depend on `alloc` without `std`.
//! * The lack of specialization makes it hard to be both generic over implementors of the standard
//!   traits while still allowing use when those traits are not available. This is in particular
//!   also since several types (e.g. `&[u8]`) implement those traits but would obviously be useful
//!   as byte sources and sinks even when they are unavailable.
//!
//! However, this is a problem for streaming decoding or selecting parts from very large data
//! structures. A crate that restricts itself to a strict `no_std` environment might accept its
//! data as a single slice or a series of slice. But it has the major limitation that all of the
//! data must be available in memory (or rather, in the address space if you utilize OS level
//! support for paging via mmap) at once. The disadvantages can range anywhere from cache
//! inefficiency, over uncontrolled latency spikes, to making the implementation actually
//! impossible.
//!
//! The goal of this crate is to allow other decoder crates to forward this implementation option
//! to the user.
//!
//! ## Usage guide
//!
//! This crate assumes you have a structure declared roughly as follows:
//!
//! ```rust
//! # struct SomeItem;
//! # use std::io::Read;
//!
//! struct Decoder<T> {
//!     reader: T,
//! }
//!
//! impl<T: std::io::Read> Decoder<T> {
//!     fn next(&mut self) -> Result<SomeItem, std::io::Error> {
//!         let mut buffer = vec![];
//!         self.reader.read_to_end(&mut buffer)?;
//! # unimplemented!()
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! There is only one necessary change, be sure to keep the `std` feature enabled for now. This
//! should not break any code except if you relied on the precise type `T` in which case you will
//! need to use a few derefs and/or `into_inner`.
//!
//! ```
//! use not_io::AllowStd;
//! # use std::io::Read;
//!
//! struct Decoder<T> {
//!     reader: AllowStd<T>,
//! }
//!
//! # struct SomeItem;
//! # impl<T: std::io::Read> Decoder<T> {
//! #    fn next(&mut self) -> Result<SomeItem, std::io::Error> {
//! #        let mut buffer = vec![];
//! #        self.reader.0.read_to_end(&mut buffer)?;
//! # unimplemented!()
//! #    }
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! And finally you can add to your crate a new default feature which enables the `std`/`alloc`
//! feature of this crate, and conditionally active your existing interfaces only when that feature
//! is active. Then add a few new impls that can be used even when the feature is inactive.
//!
//! ```
//! use not_io::AllowStd;
//! # struct SomeItem;
//!
//! struct Decoder<T> {
//!     reader: AllowStd<T>,
//! }
//!
//! /// The interface which lets the caller select which feature to turn on.
//! impl<T> Decoder<T>
//! where
//!     AllowStd<T>: not_io::Read
//! {
//!     fn no_std_next(&mut self) -> Result<SomeItem, not_io::Error> {
//! # unimplemented!()
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! /// An interface for pure no_std use with caller provide no_std reader.
//! impl<T> Decoder<T>
//! where
//!     T: not_io::Read
//! {
//!     fn not_io_next(&mut self) -> Result<SomeItem, not_io::Error> {
//!         let reader = &mut self.reader.0;
//! # unimplemented!()
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
