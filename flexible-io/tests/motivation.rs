//! Demonstrates an actual use case.
//!
//! In many cases, IO can be performed in ultimately equivalent ways. Seeking forward for instance
//! can be emulated by simply reading as many bytes as need to be skipped. The library address that
//! case, which is implemented in `read_with_skip`.
//!
//! Similarly, `BufRead` can be more efficient yet requiring it will force some callers into
//! double-buffering and rob them of the *choice* of buffering. This is demonstrated in
//! `read_TODO`.
