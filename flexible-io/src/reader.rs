/// A reader, which can dynamically provide IO traits.
///
/// The following traits may be optionally dynamically provided:
///
/// * [`Seek`]
/// * [`BufRead`]
/// * [`Any`]
///
/// The struct comes with a number of setter methods. The call to these requires proof to the
/// compiler that the bound is met, inserting the vtable from the impl instance. Afterward, the
/// bound is not required by any user. Using the (mutable) getters recombines the vtable with the
/// underlying value.
///
/// Note that the value can not be unsized (`dyn` trait) itself. This may be fixed at a later point
/// to make the reader suitable for use in embedded. In particular, the double indirection of
/// instantiating with `R = &mut dyn Read` wouldn't make sense as the setters would not be usable,
/// their bounds can never be met. And combining traits into a large dyn-trait is redundant as it
/// trait-impls become part of the static validity requirement again.
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// ```
/// # use flexible_io::Reader;
/// let mut buffer: &[u8] = b"Hello, world!";
/// let mut reader = Reader::new(&mut buffer);
/// assert!(reader.as_buf().is_none());
///
/// // But slices are buffered readers, let's tell everyone.
/// reader.set_buf();
/// assert!(reader.as_buf().is_some());
///
/// // Now use the ReadBuf implementation directly
/// let buffered = reader.as_buf_mut().unwrap();
/// buffered.consume(7);
/// assert_eq!(buffered.fill_buf().unwrap(), b"world!");
/// ```
