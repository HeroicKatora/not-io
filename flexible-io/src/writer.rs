/// The following traits may be optionally dynamically provided:

/// compiler that the bound is met, inserting the vtable from the impl instance. Afterward, the
/// bound is not required by any user. Using the (mutable) getters recombines the vtable with the
/// underlying value.
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// ```
/// # use flexible_io::Writer;
/// use std::io::SeekFrom;
///
/// let mut buffer: Vec<u8> = vec![];
/// let cursor = std::io::Cursor::new(&mut buffer);
/// let mut writer = Writer::new(cursor);
/// assert!(writer.as_seek().is_none());
///
/// writer
///     .as_write_mut()
///     .write_all(b"Hello, brain!")
///     .unwrap();
///
/// // But cursors are seekable, let's tell everyone.
/// writer.set_seek();
/// assert!(writer.as_seek().is_some());
///
/// // Now use the Seek implementation to undo our mistake
/// let seek = writer.as_seek_mut().unwrap();
/// seek.seek(SeekFrom::Start(7));
///
/// writer
///     .as_write_mut()
///     .write_all(b"world!")
///     .unwrap();
///
/// let contents: &Vec<u8> = writer.get_ref().get_ref();
